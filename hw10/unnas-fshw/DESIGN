Running the FS:




File System Layout:

  - 1MB = 256 pages (4k blocks)
  - page 0 = 256 inodes (each 8 bytes) 
  	- an array of inodes (for getting inodes)
  	
  - page 1 & inode 1 = root directory
	  - the root directory is just an array of 128 char[16]'s
	    - max filename length = 15
	    - ent[0] == '\0' means unused

  - That leaves inodes/blocks #2 - #255 for file
