### General Assignment Strategy

Assighments mostly work the same:
	- half autograder points
		- You get points for passing tests
	- half manual grading
		- You lose points for errors
		- On the shell, you lose points for not attempting features

Problem: Hard to predict how long HW will take.

Solution: work on the assignment incrementally
	- 1st, download the starter code, then submit it.
	- Next, modify the code to pass one test, then submit it.
	- Keep working one or a few tests at a time.
	- Stop when:
		- You're done OR
		- You run out of time OR
		- You get bored

It can be *faster* to build simpler versions of a program first, rather than trying to build the whole, most-complete version on the first try.

The advantage of building the simpler version of components first is that you can get the rest of the components working and tested earlier.

Finally, #1 Recommentations:
*** Never write more than 20 lines of code without running it. ***
